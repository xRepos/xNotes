Naive Bayes vs Logistic Regression

Naive Bayes ‐ generative model: P(X|y)

* makes strong conditional conditional independence independence assumption assumption about
the data attributes
* When the assumptions are ok, naïve bayes can use small amount of training training data and estimate estimate a reasonable reasonable model

Logistic regression‐discriminative model: directly learn p(y|X)

* has fewer parameters to estimate, learning harder
* Makes no strong assumptions
* May need large number of training examples



ANOVA uses categorical independent variables and a continuous dependent variable
discriminant analysis has continuous independent variables and a categorical dependent variable
