Basic Computer Science Knowledge
================================

TCP vs. UDP
-----------

### TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

* A connection-based protocol that provides a reliable flow of data between two computers.
* Example: HTTP, FTP, Telnet
* Use socket


### UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

* A protocol that sends independent packets of data, called datagrams, from one computer to another with no guarantees about arrival. UDP is not connection-based like TCP.
* Example: time request, ping
* Use datagram

URI vs. URL
-----------

* URI: there’s no guarantee that a URI has a representation. A URI is nothing but an identifier. 
* URL: A URL is an identifier that can be dereferenced.  


Kerberos
--------

kinit: talk to KDCkey distribution center=> kerberos use Authentication Server(AS) and Ticket Granting Server(TGS)
Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT)

Entropy

HATEOAS
-------

HATEOAS: **H**ypermedia **A**s **T**he **E**ngine **O**f **A**pplication **S**tate 

REST
----

REST is not a protocol, a file format, or a development framework. It’s a set of design constraints: statelessness, hypermedia as the engine of application state, and so on. 

IETF
----

Internet Engineering Task Force 

Domain Names
------------

FQDN: **F**ully **Q**ualified **D**omain **N**ame: sometimes also referred as an absolute domain name is a domain name that specifies its exact location in the tree hierarchy of the Domain Name System(DNS)


TLD: **T**op **L**evel **D**omains


Homogeneity vs. Heterogeneity
-----------------------------

Homogeneity: statistical properties of any one part of an overall dataset are the same as any other part.

Heterogeneity is the state of being heterogeneous. It is the nature of opposition, or contrariety of qualities. 

Data Mining vs. Database Querying
---------------------------------

* Database Querying: "What data satisfies this pattern (query)?" 
* Data Mining: "What patterns satisfy this data?"
